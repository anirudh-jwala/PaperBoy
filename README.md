# Paper Boy
## News App Stage 1

### Backstory: 
               This is the age of information, we live around data. Past in time, at home I was forced to read news papers that come early in
               morning even before the alarm rings. I was always a big fan of Harry Potter, one of the movie series has news paper flew over
               harry's head and land on the table with moving pictures it was truely facinating, now the same thing we can see on our phones.
               I never had a magic box (PC/Mobile) before, but soon as I got this magical power that I can use to read not just one news 
               paper but of all languages and even watch a video related to them. This time it was not a paper it was a glass screen that
               has all the virtual world hidden in it like Doremon's 4 Dimentional pocket.
               
#### Udacity Project:

This is a News Application that was developed as a part of Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree. In this I have implemented this application
after learning the following concepts into reality:

- Splash Screen Activity
- Custom Adapters
- JSON Parsing
- HTTP Networking
- Async Tasks
- Loaders
- Threads and Parallelism 
- Check Network Status
- Parsing Data from Gaurdian API
- Intents

#### Made use of the following permission in Android:

 - android.permission.INTERNET
 - android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
 
 I have decided to make it open source for my fellow Internet users for them to take full adcantage over learning new stuff.
